This repo shows music app where you can search the songs and play
Basically this app is to demo basic music app where user can serach for song and play.
This app is developed using javascript, html, css.
I would say this small project helps to practise javascript and one can learn by practicing.
This app can be develped using any other frame work
If anyone developed using other framework do post here
